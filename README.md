Housing for a pair of [ELP USB fisheye webcams](https://www.amazon.com/180degree-Fisheye-Camera-usb-Android-Windows/dp/B00LQ854AG) to create basic stereoscopic vision. Cameras are spaced for full sensor modes (640x480 for example). The alignment isn't perfect but the overall 3D effect works well enough.

I've been using this camera setup with a Raspberry Pi and a Google Cardboard headset in my [modded reality experiments](http://blog.mattbierner.com/series/modded_reality/). This housing a refined version of what I used in my [selfie stick reality experiment](http://blog.mattbierner.com/selfie-reality). It was created specifically for an upcoming experiment in third person existence. While prototyping one of these experiences, the lack of depth perception using a single camera proved rather problematic. Hopefully this camera setup will improve things.
